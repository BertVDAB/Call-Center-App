<h1 align="center" id="title">Call Center App</h1>

<h3><b>Logging made easy -&gt; Stop repetitive typing -&gt; Click and paste!</b></h3>

<p>While working for a callcenter, after the call, you have to leave a message in the file log, so when another operator calls, or the person calls back, they get information about the file state<br><br>
 For example: how many times called, how many voicemails left, what the issue is, and other relevant information, so the person you call does not have to explain the story every call</p>

<p id="description"><br><br>The company wants you to leave a message in the log input, written in a company wide used format, for example: "02/12 14:34 Called person did not reply, left voicemail"<br> Why keep typing this every call you make? You can make typos, forget date and time... <br><br><b>Automate it</b> with the click of a button.</p>
